# Project Title

This repository contains the assignments that we given for the course CS370 - Operating Systems. The course covers the book Operating System Concepts by Abraham Silberschatz, Peter Baer Galvin and Greg Gagne. All assignments are done in C on a Linux framework.

## Getting Started

If you wish to run this code, fork the repository in a Linux based system. For detailed description see the prerequisites below.

### Prerequisites/Installation

While most of the assignments can be done on on any Linux-based system, some of them require Kernels to be loaded directly onto the OS and can potentially crash your OS. Therefore it is recommended you download and install the virtual box (if you do not already have one), and [OSC-2016 Virtual Machine](http://people.westminstercollege.edu/faculty/ggagne/osc/vm/index.html).

## Running the tests

Compile the C++ code and run it.
